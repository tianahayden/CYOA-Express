You are concerned that if you stick your finger inside to fish out the note, the jagged edges will cut you, but you are curious about its continents. What do you do?",

At that moment, you see a seagull fly over your head, flying southbound. You also notice a sign in the opposite direction called 'Sirene Seagull Motel'. Which direction do you head?",
